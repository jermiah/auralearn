# 🔥 THE PROBLEM SCHOOLS FACE — REALITY IN FRANCE TODAY

Every French classroom follows the same model: **one teacher, around thirty students, and only 55 minutes** to teach.
But behind this apparent simplicity lies the biggest challenge in French education:

### **A single classroom contains 30 different levels.**

Some students are 2–3 years ahead.
Some are 2–3 years behind.
Others are struggling with attention, confidence, motivation, language barriers, or specific learning needs.

This extreme heterogeneity forces teachers to do the impossible:

- ✅ Teach advanced students who finish everything early
- ✅ Support students who cannot access the lesson
- ✅ Manage behavior caused by boredom, frustration, or confusion
- ✅ Follow the national curriculum
- ✅ Create differentiated materials for multiple levels
- ✅ All within the same 55-minute period

## The Result?

### **1. Students fall behind silently**

Because teachers simply can't diagnose learning gaps in time.

### **2. Fast learners lose interest**

Because the lesson is too slow or too repetitive for them.

### **3. Teachers drown in workload**

Because preparing 2–4 versions of every lesson takes 10–15 hours per week.

**This is not a teacher problem.**
**This is a structural system problem.**

Teachers cannot personalize for 30 students at once with the tools they have today.
- The Ministry knows it.
- Teachers know it.
- Parents know it.
- Students feel it.

**This is the challenge the hackathon asks us to solve.**

# ⭐ What LearnAura Does

LearnAura gives teachers a complete, instant understanding of every student — academically, cognitively, and behaviourally — and generates the exact resources needed to teach a mixed-level classroom effectively.

---

## 1. Academic Assessment (10 questions)

The academic assessment is built directly from the **official French national curriculum**.
The system uses AI to automatically generate smart, curriculum-aligned questions tailored to the grade and subject selected.

Teachers can:
- Share one assessment link with the entire class
- Or generate personalized versions for each student

Students complete 10 questions, and LearnAura immediately identifies who is:
- **Advanced**
- **On track**
- **Needs attention**
- **Struggling**
- **Needs immediate support**

All results appear in a clean, colour-coded heatmap that teachers understand in seconds.

---

## 2. Cognitive Profile Assessment (15 questions)

The cognitive assessment shows **how** each student learns — not just what they know.

### What it Measures:
- Processing speed
- Working memory
- Attention
- Learning style
- Self-confidence
- Motivation

### How it Works:

**Dual Assessment Approach:**

1. **Student Self-Assessment**
   - Powered by a **smart voice agent** that talks with the student
   - Listens to them and adapts to their pace and comfort level
   - Makes the assessment more personal, more accurate, and more authentic
   - 15 Likert-scale questions (1-5)

2. **Parent Assessment**
   - Similar 15 questions about their child
   - Provides external perspective on the student's learning behaviors
   - Completed independently by parents

3. **Combined Cognitive Profile**
   - Both assessments are averaged to create the final cognitive score
   - This triangulation provides more accurate and balanced insights
   - Reduces bias from single-source assessments

### Results:

Teachers instantly see each student's:
- **Primary learning category**
- **Secondary category**

Examples include:
- Visual learner
- Slow processor
- Needs repetition
- Easily distracted
- Sensitive / low confidence
- High-energy learner
- Fast processor
- Logical learner

**Insights that usually take months now appear in minutes.**

# 🎙 How You Present This to a School

## Opening (30 seconds)

"Imagine if, before every lesson, you knew exactly:
- Which students are ready for advanced work
- Which students need extra support
- How each student learns best
- What teaching strategies will work for each profile

And imagine if you could generate differentiated materials for all three groups in **one click**.

That's LearnAura."

---

## The Problem (1 minute)

"Right now, French classrooms have students working at levels 2–4 years apart.

Some students finish in 10 minutes and get bored.
Others can't access the lesson at all.

Teachers spend **10–15 hours per week** trying to create materials for different levels.

But it's impossible to truly personalize for 30 students in a 55-minute class.

The result?
- Students fall behind silently
- Fast learners lose interest
- Teachers are exhausted

This isn't a teacher problem. It's a **system problem**."

---

## The Solution (2 minutes)

"LearnAura solves this with **three simple steps**:

### Step 1: Academic Assessment
Students take a quick 10-question assessment aligned with the national curriculum.
Teachers instantly see who is advanced, on track, struggling, or needs urgent support.

### Step 2: Cognitive Assessment
Students complete a voice-based assessment that reveals **how** they learn.
Parents also complete a parallel assessment about their child.
Both are combined for accurate, balanced insights.

The system identifies:
- Visual vs logical learners
- Fast vs slow processors
- Students who need repetition
- High-energy learners
- Students with low confidence
- Attention challenges

### Step 3: Automatic Resources
LearnAura generates:
- **Differentiated worksheets** (Support/Core/Advanced) in one click
- **Personalized teaching strategies** from official French pedagogy
