# 🎯 The Problem Schools Face

Every classroom looks the same on paper. One teacher. Around thirty students.
But in reality, there are **thirty different levels, thirty different strengths, and thirty different ways of learning**.

Teachers do their best.
But they don't have enough time to individually diagnose each student's level, learning style, confidence, and cognitive needs.
So three big problems appear:

**1. Some students fall behind silently**
They need more time or repetition, but nobody sees it early enough.

**2. Fast learners get bored and lose interest**
Because they are not challenged at the right level.

**3. Teachers lose hours preparing worksheets and trying to differentiate**
And even then, it's still not personalized enough.

This is a structural problem.
Teachers cannot personalize for 30 students at once with the tools they have today.

# 🚀 What LearnAura Does (Explained Clearly)

LearnAura gives teachers a complete, instant understanding of every student.

### **1. Academic assessment (10 questions)**

Built directly from the official French national curriculum.
Generated instantly.
Students answer, and the system shows exactly who is:

* Advanced
* On track
* Needs attention
* Struggling
* Needs immediate support

Everything appears in a colour-coded heatmap the teacher understands in seconds.

### **2. Cognitive profile assessment (15 questions)**

This reveals **how** each student learns:

* Processing speed
* Working memory
* Attention
* Learning style
* Self-confidence
* Motivation

Teachers immediately see the student's **primary and secondary learning categories**, such as:

* Visual learner
* Slow processor
* Needs repetition
* Easily distracted
* Sensitive / low confidence
* High-energy learner
* Fast processor
* Logical learner

This gives teachers an understanding that normally takes months to develop.

### **3. Automatic teaching strategies based on real pedagogy**

This is where LearnAura becomes unique.

Every strategy we generate comes from **official French educational sources** and **real classroom best practices**.

Here is exactly how it works:

* We start with the **official French Ministry of Education curriculum**, downloaded directly from the government website.
* We combine it with the **official Ministry teaching guides**, which explain how to support different learners in real classrooms.
* Then we take the **top blogs and top educational videos** related to each learning category.
* We extract, transcribe, and analyse this content to capture the most practical, modern teaching methods used by teachers today.
* Finally, we blend everything: the official curriculum, the official teaching guides, the best blogs, the best videos, and current teaching practices.

The result is a **holistic, modern, and practical strategy set** for each learner profile.

Nothing is random.
Nothing is generic.
It is real pedagogy, enriched with today's best classroom techniques.

### **4. Automatic Support/Core/Advanced worksheets**

In one click, LearnAura generates differentiated worksheets so every student works at the right level.

**No extra work for the teacher.
Everything instant.
Everything personalized.**
