- Web articles and research about teaching strategies
- YouTube video transcripts with teaching tips

Generate a comprehensive teaching guide with:
1. A summary of this learning profile (2-3 sentences)
2. 3-5 key strategies with clear explanations of why they work
3. 3-4 practical classroom activities with step-by-step instructions
4. Recommended resources (from the provided web links)
5. A brief lesson plan outline for Support, Core, and Advanced groups

Focus on classroom management, lesson planning, grouping strategies, and assessment methods.
